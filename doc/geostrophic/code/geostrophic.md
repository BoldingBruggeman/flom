This model implements the geostrophic balance using FLOM to provide the 
basic building blocks. A description of can be found [here](http://www.geo.cornell.edu/ocean/p_ocean/ppt_notes/15_GeostrophicCurrents.pdf).
Salinity and temperature fields are from the [World Ocean Atlas](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/woa18/).


The model uses the following components from FLOM:
1. The input\_module (reading the NetCDF formatted salinity and temperature 
fields.
2. The input\_module
